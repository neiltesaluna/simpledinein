# Simple Dine-in

My wife and I were having a bit of trouble keeping track of our favourite recipes from our notebook as we filled it up with more content. So I've decided to create a website where we can easily find the recipe we are looking for. 

The recipes are entered in **markdown** and Django handles converting them to **HTML** when rendered using a custom template filter.

This website is generated using the [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Framework and containerized with **Docker**.
